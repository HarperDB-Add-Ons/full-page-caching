## Here we can define any tables in our database. This example shows how we define a type as a table using
## the type name as the table name and specifying it is an "export" available in the REST and other external protocols.



# This will be the table where users can store their pages they would like to cache
# Keep this table simple
type PageCache @table(expiration: 3600) @export {
    cacheControl: String 
    # Stores the Cache-Control headers for the page, which dictate how caching should be handled (e.g., max-age, no-cache).

    id: ID @primaryKey 
    # The primary key representing the URL path of the cached webpage.
    # Example: For the URL https://www.birkenstock.com/us/men/, the `id` should be "/us/men/".
    # This allows us to uniquely identify cached pages based on their path.

    cachedData: String 
    # Stores the full HTML of the cached webpage as a string.
    # This is the rendered content that will be served from cache on subsequent requests.
}
