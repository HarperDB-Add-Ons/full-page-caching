## Here we can define any tables in our database. This example shows how we define a type as a table using
## the type name as the table name and specifying it is an "export" available in the REST and other external protocols.
type TableName @table @export {
    id: ID @primaryKey # Here we define primary key (must be one)
    name: String # we can define any other attributes here
    tag: String @indexed # we can specify any attributes that should be indexed
}



# Turn this into an example table that developers can follow
type MyCache @table(expiration: 3600) @export {
	id: ID @primaryKey # Note ID should path to webpage url you are caching (e.g  in https://www.birkenstock.com/us/men/ the id should be /us/men/ )
    cachedData: String # cachedData should be the html of the webpage you are caching stored as a string
}

# This will be the table where users can store their pages they would like to cache
# Keep this table simple
type PageCache @table(expiration: 3600) @export{
    # cacheControl: String
    id: ID @primaryKey
    cachedData: String
}
