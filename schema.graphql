## Here we can define any tables in our database. This example shows how we define a type as a table using
## the type name as the table name and specifying it is an "export" available in the REST and other external protocols.



# This will be the table where users can store their pages they would like to cache
# Keep this table simple
type PageCache @table(expiration: 3600) @export{
    cacheControl: String # save cache control headers
    id: ID @primaryKey # Note ID should path to webpage url you are caching (e.g  in https://www.birkenstock.com/us/men/ the id should be /us/men/ ) This is our primary key Key
    cachedData: String # cachedData should be the html of the webpage you are caching stored as a string

}
